      <p>Doggo is a website which allows the users to search about any dog breed easily. It provides the basic required
        information that one needs to know about the dog.
      </p>
      <p>But doggo is not only limited to that. Users are also allowed to post blogs here. You share your stories and experiences
        with your dog here. We would love to hear about them all.</p>
      <p>The most fun part is that you don't have to be a member or so to use our website. Feel free to visit us anytime
        and you can drop an email to us at doggolover@gmail.com regarding any queries or feedback.
